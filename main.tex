\section{Introduction}
Landmines have caused 12,133 victims in Colombia as of January 2021 according to the Ministry of National Defense of the Country \cite{MINDEFENSA_STATISTICS}. From the 12,133 reported victims, 4,855 ($40.01\%$) are civilians while the remaining 7,278 are members of public forces \cite{MINDEFENSA_STATISTICS}. The Ministry's statistics report that 2,336 ($19.25\%$) of the victims perish from the accident, a value close to one (1) death out of five (5) accidents \cite{MINDEFENSA_STATISTICS}. Despite landmine removal efforts from the Government of Colombia and a sustained decrease through the last years, landmines accidents still occur. On hundred and forty one (141) accidents were reported in 2021 \cite{MINDEFENSA_STATISTICS}, indicating that both civilians and public forces are still in danger from landmines and unexploited ammunition.

The Universidad de Los Andes is a private research university located in Colombia that currently has an Humanitarian Demining Group as part its Department of Electric and Electronics Engineering, School of Engineering. The group promotes research, yet not exclusively, towards landmines removal and characterization. From January 2020 to March 2022, the Humanitarian Demining Group received a grant from both the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to gather data on landmines \cite{PEER_LANDMINES}. The project aims to help on the efforts of reducing the amount of victims from landmines in Colombia. As part of the project, the Group developed GPR-20, a portable robot designed to acquire data from different location in which landmines are found \cite{PEER_LANDMINES}. 

GPR-20 is a data acquisition robot used to develop new landmine detection models and algorithms. The robot uses the \textit{Ground Penetrating Radar} (GPR) technique to sample the ground in order to acquire signals that can be later used to detect landmines. The GPR is constructed using a \textit{Vector Network Analyzer} (VNA) and two PowerLOG 70180 antennae with a bandwidth of up to 5.4 GHz. The antennae are moved within the sampling area by the means of a Cartesian robot constructed using 3D printing parts. An user interface is also present in the robot to allow interaction.

An user should be able to understand the basics from the operational principles, structure and purpose of the robot by reading this document. Nevertheless further documentation is referred depending on the role of the user. Two roles are assumed from a reader: user and developer. The user is the person that will only interact with the GPR-20 to use it while the developer will interact with the robot to improve its design and performance. Further documentation for an user is a set of operational manuals for surveys. On the other hand, documentation for developers is a set of detailed documentation and guidelines for development processes.

This document consists of three main sections: an introduction of the GPR-20 robot, a reference of the robot documentation, and the repositories of the project. The introduction presents a general overview of the robot as it introduces the operation principles and its main subsystems. The reference section intends to serve as the starting point from which the reader could seek information of his/her interest. The reader should keep in mind that this guide is a start guide in which only a general information is presented. Finally, the last section provides the links to the project repositories. Repositories include both the documents and the required files for the robot to work.

\section{GPR-20 Overview}
This section presents a general overview of the GPR-20 robot. In first place, a brief review of the operational principle is introduced i.e. the \textit{Ground Penetrating Radar}. Then an overview of the robot itself is presented. This overview consists of the mechanical structure, data acquisition and electronics. A reader should be able to get a basic understanding of how the GPR-20 robot works by reading this section.

GPR-20 is a robot whose purpose is to acquire data from deactivated minefields. Data acquired using the robot will be available to researchers around the world interested in developing new detection algorithms for landmines that pose a risk for rural communities. GPR-20 design itself will be also available for groups and institutions that might want to replicate or further develop the system. In general terms, GPR-20 objective is to allow a broader scientific community to take part into landmine removal.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:gpr-gpr20} presents a render of the GPR-20 robot. The robot consists of a mechanical structure that holds a Cartesian robotic arm used to moves a positioner. The positioner is the mechanical element that moves within the sampling area and holds both the antennae and the VNA. There is another element on one of the robot sides that has a touchscreen from which the robot can be controlled. This element also stores the electronics and power systems. The robot itself is powered from an external AC source and might use an external laptop to process and analyze data as it is sampled. 

\subsection{Operation Principles}
GPR-20 operation principle is the \textit{Ground Penetrating Radar} (GPR) method. GPR is a method that uses radio waves to acquire data from the soil. There are two main methods for acquiring data using a GPR: trough reflected waves from subsurface features or transillumination of a volume. GPR-20 relies on the reflections method as is shown on figure \ref{fig:gpr-principle}. The method of reflections consists of setting up a receiver and a transmitter in a fixed geometry that is later moved to detect reflections from underground elements \cite{GPR_JOL}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{images/GPR_principles.pdf}
    \caption{Depiction of the GPR method used on the GPR-20 robot.}
    \label{fig:gpr-principle}
\end{figure}

Data acquired from the GPR consists of a set of frequency-domain values equally distributed within the bandwidth. The bandwidth used for surveys is 5.4GHz starting from 600MHz in which the amount of data points range from 256 to 4000 points. Frequency-domain data can be transformed into time-domain signals that can be interpreted as A-Scans. A-Scans can be then merged into B-Scans and C-Scans which allows visualization and analysis of two-dimensional and three-dimensional data respectively. Figure \ref{fig:gpr-scans} presents an A-Scan, B-Scan and C-Scan acquired using data acquired from a GPR. Acquisition on the GPR-20 robot is done on surveys, which consist of sampling the ground on a set of predefined spatial points. These predefined points add up to sample data from a straight line or a rectangular area. GPR-20 is able to acquire data from an area size up to 800$\times$800 square millimeters (mm\textsuperscript{2}).

\subsection{Mechanical Structure}
GPR-20 works over a structure that supports the data acquisition, electric and mechanical elements required to use the robot. The structure in which the robot relies is built from 3D printed parts, PVC tubing and miscellaneous elements like screws and nuts. This scheme allows for quick prototyping and ease of replication. GPR-20 is shown on figure \ref{fig:gpr-gpr20} in which the structure can be identified. 


\subsection{Data Acquisition}
GPR-20 acquires data by using the GPR method using two antennae and a VNA. Nevertheless a GPR data pipeline requires processing units and software that allows for coordinating data acquisition and processing. Data acquisition using the GPR-20 robot requires coordination between the Cartesian arm, the GPR and processing units. Figure \ref{fig:gpr-data} presents the data acquisition and analysis pipeline.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{images/data_pipeline.pdf}
    \caption{Data pipeline for the GPR-20 robot.}
    \label{fig:gpr-data}
\end{figure}

The data acquisition process begins with the sampling of the ground with the antennae and the VNA. The results of each sampling point are stored as raw data. After the survey is finished, data is merged into a single file that allows analysis of a 3D sampled volume. To improve data quality and value, a migration process is applied to the data. Finally, the migrated data is stored as the result of the survey process.


\subsection{Electronics}
Electronics from the GPR-20 robot can be divided into two subsystems: power and data. Power subsystem is in charge of supplying electrical energy into every robot component. Data subsystem is the organization and interconnection of electronic components that allow for data acquisition and processing.
